# EDA-GFNFF command-line program

`eda-gfnff` performs a molecular, interfragment decomposition using
the same geometry, topology, EEQ charges, repulsion parameters, and dispersion
parameters as the GFN-FF single-point calculation.

For fragments A and B, the reported quantity is

```text
E_NCI(A,B) = E_EEQ,pair(A,B) + E_rep,nonbonded(A,B) + E_disp(A,B)
           + E_HB(A,B) + E_XB(A,B)
```

The electrostatic, repulsion, and dispersion terms are accumulated from the corresponding
GFN-FF atom-pair expressions. The native GFN-FF hydrogen-bond and halogen-bond corrections
are accumulated separately from their three-center interaction lists. This is a
frozen-complex decomposition: it does not subtract separately recomputed monomer energies.
The CLI is intended for non-periodic, Cartesian molecular inputs whose fragments are not
covalently connected.

## Build

CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -Dbuild_exe=ON
cmake --build build
```

This builds both `gfnff` and `eda-gfnff` in the build directory.

Meson:

```bash
meson setup build -Dbuild_exe=true
ninja -C build
```

## XYZ input

The XYZ comment line can begin with Gaussian-style charge and multiplicity:

```text
0 1 optional comment
```

It can also contain keyed values:

```text
charge=-1 spin=2
chrg=0 multiplicity=1
```

Fragment IDs can be supplied as the fifth column of every atom line:

```text
6
0 1 water dimer
O   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000  1
H   0.758602   0.000000   0.504284  1
H  -0.758602   0.000000   0.504284  1
O   0.000000   0.000000   2.900000  2
H   0.758602   0.000000   3.404284  2
H  -0.758602   0.000000   3.404284  2
```

Run it with one integer net charge per fragment:

```bash
eda-gfnff water_dimer.xyz --frag-charges "0,0"
```

Alternatively, use a normal four-column XYZ and provide fragment IDs as either a
comma/space-separated list or a text file:

```bash
eda-gfnff water_dimer_plain.xyz \
  --frag "1,1,1,2,2,2" \
  --frag-charges "0,0"

eda-gfnff water_dimer_plain.xyz \
  --frag fragments.txt \
  --frag-charges fragment_charges.txt
```

Fragment labels are normalized in ascending numeric order. The fragment charges must
sum to the total charge read from the XYZ comment line.

## Gaussian GJF/COM input

The minimal Gaussian reader accepts Cartesian molecule specifications. Every atom must
carry a `Fragment=N` field, and the charge/multiplicity line must contain the total pair
followed by one pair per fragment:

```text
%chk=water.chk
#p hf/3-21g

Water dimer

0 1  0 1  0 1
O(Fragment=1)   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000
H(Fragment=1)   0.758602   0.000000   0.504284
H(Fragment=1)  -0.758602   0.000000   0.504284
O(Fragment=2)   0.000000   0.000000   2.900000
H(Fragment=2)   0.758602   0.000000   3.404284
H(Fragment=2)  -0.758602   0.000000   3.404284
```

Run directly:

```bash
eda-gfnff water_dimer.gjf
```

For an ion pair with fragment charges +1 and -1, the charge line is, for example:

```text
0 1  1 1  -1 1
```

The parser supports element symbols, atomic numbers, Gaussian atom metadata such as
`Element(Fragment=N)`, and an optional Gaussian freeze-code column before Cartesian
coordinates. Coordinates are interpreted in Angstrom.

The Gaussian parser is a minimal Fortran adaptation of the banelib INPUT/GJF parsing
approach, included with permission from the banelib author.

## Output

For every fragment pair the CLI prints electrostatic, nonbonded repulsion, dispersion,
GFN-FF hydrogen-bond correction, GFN-FF halogen-bond correction, and their total in
kcal/mol. It also prints the three-term subtotal and the five-term all-pairs total in
Hartree, kcal/mol, and kJ/mol. The full GFN-FF single-point energy and gradient norm are
reported separately.

The CLI also prints Multiwfn-style atomic contributions. For every cross-fragment
two-center electrostatic, repulsion, or dispersion interaction, one half of the pair
energy is assigned to each participating atom. Therefore, summing any atomic column
over the whole system exactly reproduces the corresponding all-fragment-pair energy.
The native GFN-FF HB/XB corrections are three-center interactions; their energies are
divided equally among the unique atoms participating in each correction.

An extended XYZ file is written automatically. By default, the input suffix is replaced
with `.eda.extxyz`; `-o` or `--output` selects another path. Coordinates are written in
Angstrom and all atomic energy properties are written in kcal/mol. The properties are:

```text
fragment
eda_electrostatic
eda_repulsion
eda_dispersion
eda_hbond
eda_xbond
eda_three_term
eda_total_nci
```

For example:

```bash
eda-gfnff water_dimer.xyz --frag-charges 0,0 -o water_atomic_eda.extxyz
```

The electrostatic entry is the cross-fragment pair part of the EEQ energy expression.
The one-center EEQ electronegativity/hardness terms are not assigned to fragment pairs.
The repulsion entry contains only the nonbonded GFN-FF repulsion loop. The dispersion
entry is the direct cross-fragment GFN-FF pair-dispersion contribution.

The H-bond and X-bond entries are the native GFN-FF three-center correction energies.
When an interaction contains atoms from exactly two fragments, its complete energy is
assigned to that fragment pair. If a three-center interaction spans three different
fragments, one third is assigned to each of the three fragment pairs so that the matrix
sum remains equal to the GFN-FF HB/XB contribution. Bonded, angle, torsion, bonded-ATM,
and other terms remain outside the reported interfragment NCI decomposition.

## CLI options

```text

--frag LIST_OR_FILE
--frag-charges LIST_OR_FILE
-o, --output FILE
-T, --threads N
-v, --verbose
-q, --quiet
-h, --help
```

## Library opt-in

The new matrices are also available from the Fortran library. Set the exact partition
and fragment charges before initialization, and enable decomposition before the
single-point call:

```fortran
allocate(calc%userinput)
calc%userinput%fraglist = fragment_ids
calc%userinput%fragcharges = real(fragment_charges, real64)
calc%do_eda = .true.

call calc%init(...)
call calc%singlepoint(...)

! Upper-triangle matrices, i < j:
calc%res%eda%electrostatic(i,j)
calc%res%eda%repulsion(i,j)
calc%res%eda%dispersion(i,j)
calc%res%eda%hydrogen_bond(i,j)
calc%res%eda%halogen_bond(i,j)

! Atomic arrays; each sum equals the corresponding upper-triangle matrix sum:
calc%res%eda%atom_electrostatic(i)
calc%res%eda%atom_repulsion(i)
calc%res%eda%atom_dispersion(i)
calc%res%eda%atom_hydrogen_bond(i)
calc%res%eda%atom_halogen_bond(i)
```

EDA evaluation is opt-in, so ordinary GFN-FF library calls retain their original cost
and memory behavior.
